# Diagnostic Coupling Missalignment With Machine Learning Model(MATLAB)

<h1>KNN ALGORITHM</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Developing a Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) system based on Machine Learning to diagnose coupling misalignment in rotary machines using vibration signals. This research aims to reduce downtime and maintenance costs through early fault detection with KNN Algorithm and Distence Evaluation Technique for feature Selection
